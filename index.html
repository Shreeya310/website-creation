<h2> HELLO </h2>
<p>The cab arrived late. The inside was in as bad of shape as the outside which was concerning, and it didn't appear that it had been cleaned in months.
     The green tree air-freshener hanging from the rearview mirror was either exhausted of its scent or not strong enough to overcome the other odors emitting from the cab.
      The correct decision, in this case, was to get the hell out of it and to call another cab, but she was late and didn't have a choice.
    He couldn't remember exactly where he had read it, but he was sure that he had.
     The fact that she didn't believe him was quite frustrating as he began to search the Internet to find the article. It wasn't as if it was something that seemed impossible. Yet she insisted on always seeing the source whenever he stated a fact.
